# Functional Differential Programming

This repository contains simple implementations of forward- and backward-mode automatic differentiation, written in Scala. There are two goals to this code:

1. demonstrate how automatic differentiation works (and hopefully show how simple it is); and
2. show that the chain rule forms a monad (which I haven't been able to find mentioned in the literature).
